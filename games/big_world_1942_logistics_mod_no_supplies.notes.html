								<i>A mod of the Big World: 1942 game by humbabba, humbabba@gmail.com. With many thanks to the original game and art designers.</i><br><br>
								A few mods to give some flavor of the enormous logistical challenges involved in waging a world war. Units are identical to those in the original game, except for the changes/additions noted below, mostly related to moving troops/materiel.<br><br>
								This version does not use the supply-line system implemented in the main Big World: 1942 - Logistics Mod game.<br><br>
